    <h1>First Question</h1>
      <p>
          I think the first Question is quite similar to the first one of exercise 8.4.

          So if you've already had answer to 8.4, we only need to fix a little bit based on it.
      </p>
      <p>
          I guess you must write an equation for 8.4 like "-g / l * math.sin(y)"
          <br><br>
          So what we need is to build a function like this:
          <pre>
                def fun(y,t,Ome):
                    g = 9.80665
                    l = 0.1
                    C = 3
                    return -g / l * math.sin(y) + C * math.cos(y) * math.sin(Ome * t)
          </pre>
          I put the variable Omega as a parameter for the convenience to solve the second question.
          <br><br>
          I think there's no doubt here.
          <br><br>
          Then we pay our attention to the R-K Method. I write it as this
          <pre>
                def runge_kutta(t,z,y,f,dt,Ome):
                """ t is the value of time
                    z is the value for dy/dt
                    y is the value of theta
                    f is the function 
                    dt is the step of time
                    Ome is the value of Omega
                """
                    k1 = z
                    l1 = f(y,t, Ome)
                    k2 = z + dt/2 * l1
                    l2 = f(y + dt/2*k1, t+ dt/2, Ome)
                    k3 = z + dt/2 * l2
                    l3 = f(y + dt/2*k2, t+ dt/2, Ome)
                    k4 = z + dt * l3
                    l4 = f(y + dt* k3, t + dt, Ome)
                    z_n = z + dt * (l1 + 2*l2 + 2*l3 + l4)/6.
                    y_n = y + dt * (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)/6.  
                    ys.append(y_n)                               //add y into list for plot
                    zs.append(z_n)                              // add z into list for plot
          </pre>
        I think it may be an awful one to read......If you have any question about this, just ask me.
        <br><br>
        This is the part for figure drawing
        <pre>
                t = 0.
                y = 0.
                z = 0.
                dt = .01
                ys,zs,ts = [],[],[]
                ys.append(y)
                zs.append(z)
                ts.append(t)
                count = 0
                while t <= 100:
                    y = ys[count]
                    z = zs[count]
                    Ome = 5
                    runge_kutta(t,z,y,fun,dt, Ome)
                    t += dt
                    ts.append(t)
                    count += 1
                plt.plot(ts,ys,label=Ome)
                ys,zs,ts = [],[],[]
                
                plt.xlim(0,105) 
                plt.xticks(np.linspace(0,100,21,endpoint=True))
                plt.yticks(np.linspace(-0.06,0.06,13,endpoint=True))
                ax = plt.gca()
                ax.spines['right'].set_color('none')
                ax.spines['top'].set_color('none')
                font = {'family': 'serif',
                    'color':  'darkred',
                    'weight': 'normal',
                    'size': 16,
                    }
            
                plt.title('The Driven Pendulum', fontdict=font)
                plt.ylabel(r'$\theta$ (rad)', fontdict=font)
                plt.xlabel('time (s)', fontdict=font)
                plt.savefig('D:\\Others\\test.jpg')
        </pre>
        And here is the plot
        <img src="1.jpg" >
      </p>
    
      <h1>Second Question</h1>

      <p>
        To be honest, I didn't know the precision of Omega required for this question. So I guess one

        <br><br>
        At first I think the value of omega was near the value of angular velocity of the Pendulum. But I was not sure, so I plot omega from 0 to 15, with interval of 0.5, then got a plot below.

      <p>
          Oh.. Forgot to paste the script of code here.
          <br><br>
          We only need to fix the code of the figure drawing part.
          <pre>
                plt.figure(figsize=(30,10))
                for x in np.arange(0,15,0.5):            
                    t = 0.
                    y = 0.
                    z = 0.
                    dt = .01
                    ys,zs,ts = [],[],[]
                    ys.append(y)
                    zs.append(z)
                    ts.append(t)
                    count = 0
                    while t <= 100:
                        y = ys[count]
                        z = zs[count]
                        Ome = x
                        runge_kutta(t,z,y,fun,dt, Ome)
                        t += dt
                        ts.append(t)
                        count += 1
                    plt.plot(ts,ys,label=r'$\omega$ = %f' %Ome)
                    ys,zs,ts = [],[],[]
                
                plt.xlim(0,105) 
                plt.xticks(np.linspace(0,100,21,endpoint=True))
                plt.yticks(np.linspace(-1.6,1.6,33,endpoint=True))
                ax = plt.gca()
                ax.spines['right'].set_color('none')
                ax.spines['top'].set_color('none')
                plt.legend(loc='upper right')
                font = {'family': 'serif',
                    'color':  'darkred',
                    'weight': 'normal',
                    'size': 16,
                    }
            
                plt.title('The Driven Pendulum', fontdict=font)
                plt.ylabel(r'$\theta$ (rad)', fontdict=font)
                plt.xlabel('time (s)', fontdict=font)
                plt.savefig('D:\\Others\\test.jpg')
             
          </pre>
          Then we figured out that when omega got to value like 9.5, which is quite near the value of angular velocity of the Pendulum (9.8995 = sqrt(g/l))
      </p>
      <p>
          Next few steps made the omega more precise.
          <img src="3.jpg" >
          <img src="4.jpg" >
          And till now I think maybe Omega=9.36 is the answer, for the maximum of theta is near 1.6 (pi/2 = 1.57)
      </p>
      <p>
          I couldn't confirm the correctness of my answer, maybe something was wrong with my answer so you need to check it out.
